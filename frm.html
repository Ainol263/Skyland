        It began as a hobby to fill free time, owing to hard work and persistence, the 
        interest evolved into a means of generating family revenue. A family in Kampung 
        Telaga Cina, Semeling, Bedong close here is now able to earn a decent living after 
        working on a strawberry patch that is starting to bear fruit. They didn't think the 
        plant, which is generally grown in the highlands and cold regions, could thrive in 
        the lowlands, according to Fig Suhanis Site Manager Nur Atikah Zakaria. <br> <br>

        She said the continuous effort due to interest, without thinking of the loss of time 
        and money since a year ago, is now worthwhile when the crop which was only grown for fun 
        at first is now turned into a source of family income. Since the strawberries started 
        fruiting a month ago, the farm has become the focus of many after being infected to see 
        and keep the crop thriving in low-lying areas. Even the unexpected fruit production is 
        also shared with visitors so they no longer have to go elsewhere to see strawberries. <br> <br>

        Nur Atikah said the farm was jointly managed by her cousin, Harusani Saari, and his wife, 
        Suhada Razak who initially planted only 50 trees. Almost all of our family members have the 
        same interest, which is to get involved in agriculture since long ago. Before this, we did a 
        lot of planting flowers for decoration alternated with fruit trees, he said. <br> <br>

        More than 2,000 tourists have come to observe and buy strawberries and canned goods since the 
        strawberry farm was afflicted, he claims. Visitors traveled from all around Malaysia, including 
        Johor, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, and Kuala Lumpur, to see Laman Fig Suhanis' accomplishment in 
        growing strawberries and figs. According to visitor feedback, our strawberries were distinct 
        from other products since they were neither too sweet nor too sour. Visitors also buy the seeds 
        of the two trees to take home, despite the fact that canned fruit is believed to be better, he 
        said. They also seek guidance from agricultural-related authorities and make referrals in order 
        to boost farm output. <br> <br>
